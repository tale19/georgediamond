Venues he has performed at range from state of Art theaters on a cruise ships, casinos and resorts, smaller, more intimate places, such as restaurants and hotels to shopping malls, various companies' headquarters and embassies.</p>
    <p>Besides performing illusions and stage magic, he offers two very special acts that have brought him numerous bookings worldwide. His Quickchange Act featuring beautiful and very visual quick costume changes as well as his solo Chinese Mask Change act - amazing, visual, and, in the western countries - still a very rare form of Chinese traditional magical artistry.</p>
    <p>George has two lovely showgirl assistants, both of them being experienced professional dancers. They bring beauty, graciousness and passion to his stage performances. In his shows he is often accompanied by one of them or both, while he also has several different one man shows on his repertoire.</p>
    <p>George and his team have recently achieved a great success and a huge media coverage becoming the superfinalists of the Serbia's Got Talent TV show. Their performance absolutely blew away the judges and the TV audiences as they succeeded from one phase of the contest to the other.</p>
